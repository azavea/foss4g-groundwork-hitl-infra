Once you can get from a model to predictions to an improved model, you can repeat that process any number of times. That's the loop. You're the human. Let's rock.\n",

    "A note on the environment: this notebook is written to run inside a container launched by `docker/run` on `master` in the `raster-vision` repo. If you're not sure how a dependency is available, why we didn't set things up in advance, or why we're in Python 3.6, that's the reason. Additionally, the environment configured by this repository's ansible scripts makes sure that we have some specific data in a specific location. If you run this outside of that configured environment, you'll need to specificy a different path to your data.\n",

    "Before, we set a task status of `UNLABELED` when we created tasks, then `LABELED` when we uploaded labels to them. There's a more advanced status, `VALIDATED`, that indicates that a human has reviewed some labels and signed off on them. We can use the validation process in GroundWork to correct the predictions produced by Raster Vision.\n",

    "The validation workflow uses GroundWork. After you're done with that, come back here.\n",

    "Done validating? Great. Let's create some new training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, we'll create a STAC export. STAC is short for the [spatio-temporal asset catalog specification](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec), an open, extensible standard for describing geospatial data. GroundWork knows how to export, and Raster Vision knows how to train models from, STAC catalogs implementing the [label extension](https://github.com/stac-extensions/label). We can create a new export using the `/stac` endpoint:"
